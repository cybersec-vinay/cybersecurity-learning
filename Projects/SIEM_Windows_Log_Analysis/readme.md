## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

### ðŸ”¹ Project Name  
**Windows Security Logs Analysis using Splunk (SIEM Project)**  

### ðŸ”¹ Objective  
This project focuses on **analyzing Windows Security Event Logs** using **Splunk Cloud** to detect potential **brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, and privilege escalations**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Scope  
- **Dataset Used:** Extracted from **Windows Event Viewer**  
- **Tools & Technologies:**  
  - **Splunk Cloud** (For Log Analysis & SIEM)  
  - **Windows Security Logs (.CSV format)**  
  - **Splunk Query Language (SPL)** for querying data  

### ðŸ”¹ Methodology  
1. **Extract Windows Security Logs** from Event Viewer  
2. **Upload logs to Splunk Cloud** for analysis  
3. **Run security queries** to detect failed logins, privilege escalations, and suspicious IP addresses  
4. **Create dashboards** to visualize security incidents  
5. **Generate a Security Incident Report** based on findings  

### ðŸ”¹ Expected Outcome  
By the end of this project, we will:  
âœ… Identify potential **brute-force attacks & unauthorized access attempts**  
âœ… Detect **privilege escalation activities** using security logs  
âœ… Present findings in a **structured incident report**  
âœ… Build a **dashboard in Splunk** to monitor security threats
